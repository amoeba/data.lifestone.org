  <p>Ulysses, Ulysses — Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth, flying in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses —
    Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his power, and with all of his might. Ulysses — no-one else can do the things
    you
    do. Ulysses — like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses — always fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and
    justice to all.

  <p>This is my boss, Jonathan Hart, a self-made millionaire, he's quite a guy. This is Mrs H., she's gorgeous,
    she's one
    lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of both of them, which ain't
    easy,
    'cause when they met it was MURDER!
  </p>
  <p>There's a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that's where I'll always be. Every stop I make, I make a
    new
    friend. Can't stay for long, just turn around and I'm gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down, Until
    tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on.
